## Improvements 

I definitely noticed when the favorites carousal was shown the breed details were not updating with each favorited cat, however i did not have adequate time to implement this. 

Here what i added that was extra: when you favorite the red heart stays, and the cat images are no longer stretch out because i changed the object fit property.
